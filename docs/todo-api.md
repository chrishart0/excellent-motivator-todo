Setting Up DynamoDB Local for Multi-User Support:

Docker Container: Use a Docker container to run DynamoDB Local. This will simulate the DynamoDB environment for local development.
Docker Compose Integration: Include the DynamoDB Local container in your docker-compose.yml to streamline the development process.
Defining Data Model for To-Do Items:

In DynamoDB, create a table for your to-do items. Use a primary key that combines a user ID (to support multiple users) and the to-do item ID.
Include attributes like title, description, status, priority, and due date in your data model.
Developing the To-Do API with FastAPI:

Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in your FastAPI application.
Use a Python SDK like Boto3 for interacting with DynamoDB.
Local Testing and Development:

Test the API against DynamoDB Local. Ensure all CRUD operations work correctly for to-do items, with proper user-based filtering.
Develop unit and integration tests for your API, simulating interactions with DynamoDB.
Implementing User Authentication:

Integrate user authentication in your API to ensure that each user can access only their data.
You can use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for securing your API endpoints.
Preparing for AWS Deployment:

After local development and testing, prepare your application for deployment on AWS.
In your production environment, switch from DynamoDB Local to the actual AWS DynamoDB service.
Documentation and Error Handling:

Document the API endpoints and the data model.
Implement error handling, particularly for database interactions and user authentication.
